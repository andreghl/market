MARKET MODEL
==============

This codebase contains code that attempts to simulate the processes and investors' behavior in double auctions. 

MATCHING
---------------------

The main condition for a match is that bid price > ask price but generally sellers want to sell at a high price (upward pressure on ask prices) and buyer want to buy at a lower price (downward pressure on bid prices).

asks = [53, 79, 85, 90, 94, 98, 113, 121]
bids = [37, 69, 82, 82, 91, 112, 120, 125]
